# LIFX Sequence Recorder
See a lightshow video on YouTube that you'd like to reproduce with your LIFX bulbs? This Chrome extension lets you record light color data in a format that you can replay to your own bulbs using [LIFX Animator](https://github.com/galehouse5/LifxAnimator).

## How to
These steps assume the Chrome extension is already installed.
1. Navigate to the lightshow video on YouTube. For example, [Gary Davis's sequence of Katy Perry's Dark Horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u2c9H4stVk).
2. Stop the video and seek to a frame that reveals the position of a light that you'd like to record. Click on the light's position and a marker is created over it. Create markers for all of the lights that you'd like to record. (Drag a marker to fine-tune its position or double click a marker to remove it.)
3. Seek to the start of the video (or whatever frame you'd like to start recording) and let the video play through (or stop the video to stop recording). When the video finishes playing (or is stopped), a sequence file containing light color data is automatically downloaded.
